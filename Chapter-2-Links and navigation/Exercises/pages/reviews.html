        <p> (9/10) One of the best supernatural shows ever <br>
          Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. 
          Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as 
          this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be 
          the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last 
          season and going to miss it when it's gone!</p>
        <p> (9/10) Lives up to all the hype <br>
          Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for 
          good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be 
          great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 
          1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so 
          hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!</p>
        <p> (8/10) Never judge a book by its cover <br>
          I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school 
          transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that 
          grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. 
          I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is 
          abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment.</p>
