        <h1>Stranger Things</h1>
      
        <h2 id="plot">Overview of the Plot</h2>
        <p>Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States 
          Department of Energy but secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. They have inadvertently created a portal to an alternate dimension they 
          refer to as the Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.
      
          The first season begins in November 1983. Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce; the town's police chief, Jim Hopper; and a group of volunteers search 
          for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes from the laboratory and is found by friends of Will. Eleven befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will.
          
          The second season is set a year later in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but he begins having premonitions of the fall of Hawkins caused by a creature in the Upside Down. When it is 
          discovered that Will is still being possessed by an entity from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn that there is a larger threat to their world.
          
          The third season is set several months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, 
          putting the majority of other local stores out of business due to the mall's popularity. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship and becomes very protective 
          of his daughter. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory underneath Starcourt seeks to open the gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer uses mind control to make Billy 
          do his bidding.
          
          The fourth season is set several months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to Lenora, California for a fresh start. In California, Eleven struggles with the loss
           of her powers and being bullied in school. Meanwhile, in Hawkins, a being from the Upside Down—an entity later dubbed Vecna—begins killing the residents of Hawkins, opening new gates between 
           the two worlds in the process. Planning to stop Vecna, Dr. Sam Owens takes Eleven to a facility to help her regain her powers. Simultaneously, Joyce and Murray fly to Russia to rescue Hopper 
           from the Gulag in Kamchatka.</p>

        <p>Development: </p>
        <p>"Stranger Things" was created by the Duffer Brothers, who faced initial challenges pitching the concept to networks due to skepticism about child protagonists. After being approached by 
          Dan Cohen and Shawn Levy of 21 Laps Entertainment, Netflix purchased the series for a full season. The setting was changed from Montauk to Hawkins, and the title "Stranger Things" was chosen.
          Visual and musical references from classic films of the 1970s and 1980s were used to establish the series' tone during the pitching process.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Writing: </p>
        <p>The concept for "Stranger Things" stemmed from the Duffer Brothers' desire to expand the moral struggles of a father from the film "Prisoners" into a serialized television approach, focusing 
          on a missing child and introducing a monster element grounded in Cold War-era science. They drew inspiration from various 1980s pop culture influences, including Stephen King novels, 
          Spielberg films, and video games. Opting for an eight-episode format on Netflix allowed them to balance narrative development and characterization. They aimed to create a satisfying 
          standalone season while leaving room for further exploration of the series' mythology. The characters, particularly the children, were influenced by the Duffer Brothers' own experiences as 
          outcasts in high school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Casting: </p> 
        <p>In June 2015, Winona Ryder and David Harbour joined the series "Stranger Things" as Joyce and the chief of police, respectively. Ryder was suggested for the role of Joyce by the casting 
          director due to her prominence in 1980s films, while Harbour was chosen for his ability to portray a broken, flawed character. Additional casting included Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, 
          Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, and others. Auditions involved reading lines from "Stand by Me," with Wolfhard's film knowledge aiding his casting. 
          Casting began before scripts were complete, allowing actors' interpretations to influence the characters. Matthew Modine provided input on his character, Dr. Brenner, helping to develop 
          him further.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Filming: </p>
        <p>The Duffer Brothers initially intended to film "Stranger Things" in Long Island but shifted to Atlanta, Georgia, due to weather constraints. Many locations in Georgia, including Atlanta 
          and surrounding areas, served as the backdrop for filming, with Emory University, Bellwood Quarry, and Stone Mountain Park among them. After considering making the Starcourt Mall set a 
          permanent attraction, producers ultimately decided against it. Production for the fourth season began in early 2020 but was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, later resuming 
          in September 2020. Plans for the fifth and final season were delayed due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Visual Effects: </p>
        <p>The Duffer Brothers created an aged effect for "Stranger Things" by adding film grain over the footage, capturing the feel of 1980s films from Amblin Entertainment. They aimed to evoke mood 
          and atmosphere over violence, aligning with the tone of PG-13-rated movies from that era. Practical effects were prioritized, including an animatronic Demogorgon, although digital effects were 
          used for complex scenes. The title sequence, designed by Imaginary Forces, used sliding letters against a black background, inspired by 1980s title sequences and input from industry veterans. 
          The sequence, initially developed with various fonts, was finalized with the ITC Benguiat font and incorporated computer-generated effects reminiscent of 1980s techniques.</p>

        <h2 id="review">Reviews</h2>
        <p> (9/10) One of the best supernatural shows ever <br>
          Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not 
          only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. 
          As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this 
          show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone!</p>
        <p> (9/10) Lives up to all the hype <br>
          Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! 
          It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with 
          this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't 
          wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!</p>
        <p> (8/10) Never judge a book by its cover <br>
          I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality 
          is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's 
          gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. 
          Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment.</p>
